The post content goes here.

Note that a post file name should follow this syntax : YY-MM-DD-title.md
This template doesn't show up in posts since it doesn't follow this syntax.
However, for example, 2018-08-20-bananas.md is a valid post file name.

Here, the title of the post would be automatically set to "Bananas", but if you want a different 
title displayed, the header variable in the font matter can be set to something different
that will be displayed instead.
